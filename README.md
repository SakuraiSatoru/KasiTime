# KasiTime
A chrome extension helping to grab kasi on http://www.kasi-time.com/
#Confirmed Nonsense
Got annoyed about the uncopyable kasi on kasi-time and wrote the extension in Jan. 2015.

Find the extension helpful (for about 10 minutes) before realizing that other extensions like "Enable Coby" does far more usage!!! T_T

Well at least it is a good(simple) sample of grabbing HTML DOM by chrome extension at a cost of 2 hours' coding... :(
